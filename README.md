# IPCameraFinder
My first cyber project, goal to test a given IPv4 range for IP Camera streams. currently experimenting with batch scripts and logic as the only functioning scripts as of yet have been unsuccessful as far as detecting streams. i need to read a book to understand the environment better as knowing the commands and syntax without more context has me "so close yet so far"
# abstract
we (the program) will curl known camera streams, extract relevant keywords, curl random IP4 addresses and looking mostly for the title and redirect section of the curl response where streams can be given away. this basic funciontality is what the current goal is.

# modules we need
1 generate IP address.
2. test url - use curl and detect with word list, -- attempt to use 554 or 8080 after just regular http req?
4. log detections
