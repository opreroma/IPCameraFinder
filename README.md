this project is a work in progress
it uses generally primitive tactics but you don't need any API key, etc to run it

current keywords.txt is not sufficient but that should (?) be the only substantial limitation
more options and gui coming soon

how it works
*generate - generates a random ip 
*detect - curl's ip and sends output to templog , checks for keywords, and appends IP info to permlog. 

more changes coming hopefully soon
